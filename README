Instructions
Open your preferred text editor and create a new Python file.

Copy and paste the  code into your file:

Save the file with a meaningful name, such as "shutdown.py".

To shutdown, restart or logout your computer, simply call the corresponding function:
shutdown() # shutdown the computer
restart() # restart the computer
logout() # logout the current user


Note that the shutdown and restart functions have a delay of 1 second before they take effect. You can change the delay by modifying the value after the "/t" flag.

Security Considerations
Be cautious when using scripts that have the ability to shutdown or restart your computer, especially if they are run remotely or automatically. Make sure that you trust the source of the script and that it is being used for legitimate purposes.

Compatibility
This script should work on Windows, Linux and macOS systems. However, the exact syntax of the shutdown command may vary depending on your operating system.
